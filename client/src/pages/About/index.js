                <p className={"card-text"}>With a love for coding and learning, along with an academic background in physics from Drexel University and web development from the University of Pennsylvania LPS, I have gained a knowledge base and skill set that are geared toward engineering & software development. Computer based problem solving has become my forte. Throughout much of my coursework and vocational experiences, I've always worked well in collaboration with others, showcased good written and oral communications and grasped many different kinds of complex systems or subject matters. Above all, I have learned to become a trustworthy and hardworking individual who is also a fast, eager and yet careful learner. I look forward and strive to make computing, along with myself, better for the world.</p>
